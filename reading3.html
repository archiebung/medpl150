    <p>I chose the reading "Tetteh: The Prisoner; 'My Punishment'. This reading is incredibly important and interesting, and utilizes illustration in a very important and unique way. Illustration was used in order to express emotion and feeling in a way that photography cannot. Photography shows what can be seen, while illustration is able to show what cannot be seen by others. This is shown with the panel where we see Tetteh's husband get angry with her, and the color of the panel changes along with his facial expression. Since Tetteh is in prison, art does something photography cannot, which is allow us to see her and hear her story. This piece was published in 2020 during COVID, meaning that no one was allowed to see her. Art allowed her story to be told, even when she wasn't able to tell it. Art spread awareness for her, since she did not have access to anything else. Art allows the reader to get her full story, as seen when her baby was born. We as the reader get to see her thoughts and her fears and get to see her in a light that not many other people have seen her in. Photography would not be able to capture every moment that she wanted to be captured. Photography wouldn't be able to show case each moment she was alone. She would not be able to be photographed when she was at home and in crucial moments that the story shows. Illustration allows the reader to see and know exactly what Tetteh wants us to see and know.</p>
