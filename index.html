    <h1>Archie Iglesias' MEDPL 15O Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about creation in a world where art is undervalued. The use of AI is becoming increasingly scary for artists, and as an artist, I believe it is my duty to create in order to fight back against this. I love to create because art is beautiful and it is an outlet to express myself, not because I want to make something quickly and easily. Real art shouldn't be easy. Art is painful, time consuming, emotional, and scary, but that is what makes it meaningful. That is what makes it art. Simplifying art, or, trying to, doesn't work. A piece of art generated soullessly by someone who doesn't understand art will never have the same impact as a piece by a real artist using their own abilities as opposed to those of an artificial intelligence model. </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Creating this website has been much more fun than I expected, and I am looking forward to learning more about website creation. Everything about creating this website thus far has gotten me excited for future classes, as I cannot wait to be able to add more to my website to make it look prettier and more professional. I am expecting the coding process to get more difficult, and, even though I have very little coding experience prior to this class, I am excited and anticipating a fun challenge. I can't wait to see how my coding proficiency grows from now up until the end of this semester, and I hope I learn a lot of valuable information about what makes a good website so that I can use this information in the future outside of school.</p>
