  <body>My original photomontage was based on the treatment of sharks and how bad stereotypes and press about sharks cause people to hate them and cause them to be killed off more often. With the shapes, I created a bunch of red circles and put them outside of the tv to represent how mistreatment of sharks and misrepresentation of sharks in media such as tv and movies causes unnecessary shark deaths and causes them to be hated and treated poorly. I found it easy to figure out how to use the tools to create the shapes and change the alignment of them on the page. However, the trickiest part for me was being able to figure out how to incorporate the shapes into my photomontage, as it felt out of place with the images that I used and having such contrasting imagery and styles.</p>
