    <h2>A powerful quote I found in this reading was "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. This reading speaks a lot about the power that photography holds, and talks about how important photography is and how it has developed. A big aspect of photography, according to the reading, is that it is used as proof. Photographs are important because they aren't abstract. Words can be changed and obfuscated, while an image shows what it shows. Photos show things for what they are, but they can also be used to push forward beliefs and arguments. Photographers tend to use societal standards of beauty and appearance in their photos to make their images as appealing to audiences as they possibly can be. While photography was initially an expensive hobby dedicated to only those who had the money to blow on a camera, photography is not quite like this now. Cameras are much more accessible, and even without a camera, anyone can take pictures with other devices. The reading takes an interesting turn, moving to speak about the sexuality of photography. I found this part very interesting, as I had never thought about the fact that photograpy can feel "perverse" as the reading says, as it can be used as a way of taking advantage of people and viewing them in a new, intimate light. Photography, in this way, isn't supposed to be comfortable. As said earlier, photography is real. It shows what it shows, not an altered form of whatever was happening. While photography can be beautiful, it can also show the worst parts of the world and reality. The reading talks about photos of starving families dying due to a famine, and how this impacts viewers.</h2>
