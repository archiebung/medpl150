    <p>I enjoyed creating this image for Homework 4, as I was able to insert personal interests of mine and use photoshop tools I wasn't used to. At first, it was very confusing for me to get a hang of the editing, as I was cutting images out and using mixing layers to mess with color and opacity. I had used mixing layers on other apps like Procreate so I was able to get a hang of what everything did after a while, but Photoshop is still quite confusing for me so I still struggled at the beginning. The image did not come out perfect, however, I do not dislike it. I think the main issue I ran into was finding the images. I had ideas of what I wanted to do, but struggled to find images that corresponded to the idea I had inside my head. I think if I were to do an assignment like this again, I would try to take the pictures on my own so that I have more leniency.</p>
