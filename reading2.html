    <p>This article on AI slop is incredibly refreshing in a world where it seems as if everyone is using AI without considering any of the drawbacks. AI has been used in ways that hurt those who are not privileged, and it is incredibly hurtful to see the normalization of it. As the article states, AI has an inherent bias against minorities, since it gathers information from a primarily white set of data. Many AI users contribute to this bias, as AI is used often for political, racist, sexist, bigoted agendas. The most disgusting example of this I've seen is with the ICE and homeland security US twitter accounts. These accounts have been seen to post AI content making fun of immigrants in the US. The president has also been seen posting AI videos on truth social. One I remember specifically is an AI video of him in a helicopter dropping poop from the skies onto No Kings protestors. I think it is genuinely absurd that stuff like this is normalized, especially from the president of the United States. This article does a great job of touching on what AI content really is- slop. AI is being normalized everywhere as a way to make things easier. This, in my opinion, is disgusting. Humanity is what makes things real. As an artist, I create art because I enjoy the process and the result. I have never once wished that I could pump out art faster by using AI, because then it would not be art. It would not be mine. I enjoy the process of creation, because it is me. It is human. Using AI to cheat the creative process objectively makes whatever is created worthless. Art is important because it is human. AI art is not art. There is no passion nor soul in AI art, and it is important to recognize this before it is too late.</p>
