    <p>I chose this image because I liked the water and thought it would be interesting to have the water as the middleground as it was a way to clearly split up the foreground and background. It was also tricky to find images that had a clear foreground, middle ground, and background that didn't seem too complicated, so this one seeemd perfect for what I needed. I reinterpeted this image using a very light color pallette with colors that were all similar. I thought this was an interesting way to reinterpret this, as the original picture was a mix of dark and light and had more natural colors, so I thought a pastel color pallette would give a different feeling to the image.</p>
