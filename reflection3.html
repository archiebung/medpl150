    <p>This was a very interesting homework assignment for me. I am not comfortable with Photoshop just yet, but I found using these filters to be very easy and useful. I liked using the field blur, and think it will be fun to experiment with. However, what I enjoyed most was the camera raw filter. With the photo I used for this part, a big problem I had was the coloring of the photo. I knew from the beginning that I really wanted to accentuate the yellow, and I was easily able to do this. This is one thing that the camera and the field blur don't let you do as easily. Working with colors is best with the camera raw filter. However, for the field blur, I found it much easier to use the field blur on Photoshop then try to perfectly blur a photo when taking a picture with a camera. I am not great at using the camera yet, and the field blur allows me to blur areas which needed to be blurred, and easily keep the spots I want to be unblurred. All three methods of photography are great though, and I need to work on them all more to improve my proficiency.</p>
